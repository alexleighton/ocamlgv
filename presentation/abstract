Graphs are abstract representations of grups of objects where some of the objects are related. In a computer, there is no inherent visual structure of a graph, as they are usually represented as a list of objects and a list of connections. This project explores the algorithms necessary for creating visualizations of graphs and discusses the tradeoffs one can make to simplify the problem.
