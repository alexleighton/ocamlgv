As of last writing, ocamlgv is at version 0.0.1. Here's the roadmap:

  [X]  1. Complete basic make/distribution system.
         [X]  a. Complete Makefile
         [X]  b. Complete related INSTALL/README/LICENSE files.

  [X]  2. Complete windowing/image convenience module.
         [X]  a. Decide on internal data representation of a drawing.
         [X]  b. Create display function with type:
                     val display : image -> ()
                 that correctly displayes the internal image on a window.

  [ ]  3. Complete Ocamlgraph input/output convenience module.
         [X]  a. Function for correctly reading in *.dot files.
         [ ]  b. Function for correctly writing to *.dot files.
         [X]  c. Miscellaneous convenience graph functions.

  [X]  4. Complete [1 or 2 or 3] graph drawing algorithms that link up 
          from graph to display window.

  [X]  5. Complete proper build system for ocamlgv.
         [X]  a. Build the whole project with one command.
         [X]  b. Build all documentation with one command.

  [ ]  6. Complete proper build system to install ocamlgv as a library.
         [ ]  a. Create proper build to pack all modules into 1 *.cma or
                 *.cmxa file.
         [ ]  b. Create proper build to install files using findlib.
